# Octopos Word Frequency test #

This file describes the steps to be used in replicating this test. It also document all the answers to the tasks prescribed.


### MySQL DB setup ###

There are two main methods of using MySQL in the google cloud; the  google cloud SQL which offers MySQL as a webservice and the manual deployment option on a google cloud compute VM. The main difference being that the former alleviates users from the stress of having to manage replications nd other database management tasks. Since this is a test with the code not for production use, I opted to go for the later (manual deployment). I followed the guide in this [document](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/setup-mysql) to set it up.
